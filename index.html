        <p>Hello! Amevor Samuel is my name, and I'm a native of Accra, Ghana. I'm a BYU student studying software development and I like hoops.October 7th, 2000 is my birthday. Ghana's Volta RegionÂ is my hometown. From 2013 to 2016, I attended Evangelical Presbytarian School in Accra for my pre-primary education. I started my senior high school study at the Keta school in the Volta Region in 2016. My favorite outfits are a stylish pair of pants and a red jacket, and my favorite foods are chicken and rice. I also enjoy reading books a lot. I was elected class captain and head boy of my school at a young age because I demonstrated the traits of a good leader. I'm a youthful, passionate man that is constantly willing to learn new things. I enrolled in the BYU course on computer skills, web development, and software development. I quickly became proficient at typing on a computer, and by the first week of the program, I was learning HTML and Python in addition to how to compose emails. During the second week of my course, I had already begun composing his initial code. </p>

        <p>The Kwame Nkrumah Memorial Park (KNMP) is located in downtown Accra, the capital of Ghana. It is dedicated to the prominent Ghanaian leader Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah. The memorial complex was dedicated in 1992, and is situated on the site of the former British colonial polo grounds, where the independence of Ghana was declared, in Accra. The KNMP's mausoleum, designed by Don Arthur, houses the bodies of Dr. Kwame Nkrumah and his wife Fathia Nkrumah. The building is meant to represent an upside-down sword, which in Akan culture is a symbol of peace. The mausoleum is clad from top to bottom with Italian marble, with a black star at its apex to symbolize unity.
